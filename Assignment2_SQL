Q1)
Sales
Transaction_ID | amount | Customer_ID | Date | num_units | product_ID | weeks

Product
Product_ID | Product_Name | Product_Category

List out the products that don’t have any sales in last two consecutive weeks

Select p.product_ID,p.Product_Name from Sales s inner join Product  p on s.product_ID=p.Product_ID where week not in (week n, week n-1 )

List out the products that don’t have any sales in any two consecutive weeks

Select p.product_ID,p.Product_Name,lead(weeks) as l_week over(partition by Product_ID order by weeks) from Sales s inner join Product  p on s.product_ID=p.Product_ID where week - l_week>2;

Q2)
Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.
The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.
Return result table in any order without duplicates.
The query result format is in the following example:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
Output should look like:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8 and 9 don't report their work to the head of company directly or indirectly.

Data population:
-- create a table
CREATE TABLE employee (
  employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  manager_id INTEGER NOT NULL
);
-- insert some values
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'Boss', '1');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (3, 'Alice', '3');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (2, 'Bob', '1');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (4, 'Daniel', '2');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (7, 'Luis', '4');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (8, 'Jhon', '3');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (9, 'Angela', '8');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (77, 'Robert', '1');
-- fetch some values
SELECT * FROM employee;


Ans) SELECT e1.employee_id FROM employee e1 inner join employee e2 on e1.manager_id=e2.employee_id inner join employee e3 on e2.manager_id=e3.employee_id where e3.manager_id=1 AND e1.employee_id!=1;
